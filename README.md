# Restaurant Business Rankings 2020

## Context

The year 2020 is behind us, therefore, many summaries of this pandemic year are created, e.g. in the form of rankings. Such a list (or actually 3 lists) was created by the "Restaurant Business" magazine. On the website you can find only basic information about ranked restaurants, full data and analyzes are available in the paid report.


## Dataset Content

The data was obtained by means of web scraping, i.e. data download with the use of programming code based on the website code. In this case, the "rvest" package from the R programming language was used along with the "SelectorGadet" browser add-on to facilitate work with the website.

The data was downloaded from www.restaurantbusinessonline.com on January 30, 2021 with three plants describing 3 rankings: top 250, top 100 indenents and future 50 thus creating 3 tables, where the restaurant is described by several variables in each row.


### Dataset Inspiration

The data can be used to tell the story of what 2020 was like for restaurants, what was hot, what could be more popular soon, or what the difference is between large companies and smaller businesses. I am curious what useful information can be obtained from this data!
